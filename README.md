# CCSU_CET_453 Microcomputer Use ASSEMBLY Language Programming with IAR Embedded Workbench software ( code file . asm) 
Integrated with MSP430G2553 microprocessor/microcontroller - Texas Instrument hardware development kit.

Microcontroller architecture including:
   * Basic memory design, 
   * Address decoding and internal register structure. 
Assembly language programming including:  
   * Addressing modes and instruction set consists of programming and interfacing experiments. 
Projects focus on solving real world problems following a standard development process.
